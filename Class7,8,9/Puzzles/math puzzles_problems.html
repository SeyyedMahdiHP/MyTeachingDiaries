<h1>Problems And Puzzles</h1>

<p>Some of these are <strong>very</strong> simple, some are not
<em><strong>so</strong></em> simple, some are just jokes.</p>

 <li id="awasser"> (from Adam Wasserman)
  <p>What is the degree of the highest exponent of K when you
   complete the operation:</p>
  <blockquote><p><code> (K-A)(K-B)(K-C)...(K-Y)(K-Z) </code></p></blockquote>

 <li id="sharapov"> (from Ilya Sharapov)
  <p>Prove that for any integer <code>n</code> the number
  <code>[(2+sqrt(3))<sup>n</sup>]</code> is odd.
  (<code>[x]</code> is the integer part of <code>x</code>)</p>

 <li id="escalator">
  2 kids, John and Jim, are running on an escalator (a moving
  stairway).  John is running three times as fast as Jim, and by the
  time they are off the escalator, John has stepped on 75 stairs while
  Jim has stepped on 50 stairs.  How many stairs does the escalator
  have?  How is its speed related to the speed of the boys?  Were they
  running with or against the escalator?

 <li id="sequences">
  Consider a sequence of <code>n+1</code> integers
  <code>a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub></code> such
  that <code>a<sub>k</sub>=#{j|a<sub>j</sub>=k}</code>.  I.e.,
  <code>a<sub>0</sub></code> is the number of zeros in the sequence,
  while <code>a<sub>20</sub></code> in the number of 20-ies in it.
  E.g., the sequence of length 4 <code>[1;2;1;0]</code> satisfies the
  condition: these is only one zero there, so
  <code>a<sub>0</sub>=1</code>, there are two ones, so
  <code>a<sub>1</sub>=2</code>, there is one two, so
  <code>a<sub>2</sub>=1</code>, and there are no threes, so
  <code>a<sub>3</sub>=0</code>.  Describe all such sequences.

  <p>Prove that for any positive integer n, the finite product

 <li id="measure">
  Is it possible to split the unit segment <code>I=[0;1]</code> into
  two "uniformly same-size" subsets <code>A</code> and <code>I-A</code>,
  i.e., so that any subsegment <code>J=[a;b]</code> of <code>I</code>
  would intersect <code>A</code> and <code>I-A</code> on sets of the
  same Lebesgue measure?  (If you don't know what "Lebesgue measure" is,
  don't worry - it's just a generalization of the ordinary length to
  "bad" sets).

 <li id="bike">
  2 pedestrians have one bike.  They travel as follows: the first one
  rides the bike for some time, then drops it and continues walking in
  the same direction, while the second follows him by foot.  Eventually,
  the second one finds the bike and rides it until he overtakes the
  first one.  Then he gives the bike to the first one etc.  Assuming
  that they walk with the same speed and bike faster than they walk,
  what is the speed of their travel?

 <li id="cars">
  N cars, each having a different speed, are going along a 1-lane
  road, so no passing is possible.  Eventually, the cars will accumulate
  in packets, with the "fast" cars tailgating the "slow" ones.  E.g., if
  the initial order was 1,5,2,4,3 (1 being the slowest, 5 being the
  fastest), we will end up with 3 packets: {1}, {5,2} and {4,3}.  Find
  the average number of packets as a function of N.

 <li id="code-lock">
  A lady is locked in a dungeon, while the vile monster went to get
  firewood.  When the monster is back in 15 min, he will cook and eat
  the lady.  The lock is an advanced coded one: it has 4 oriented
  (top/bottom) spikes in a drum, arranged in a square and invisible.
  The lady can put her two hands into the drum, feel 2 of the spikes
  (adjacent or diagonal), determine their orientation and change it as
  she wishes.  If all 4 spikes end up the same direction (up or down),
  the lock opens and she can escape.  If not, the drum rotates quickly
  for 1 min (so that she does not know which spikes she touched), then
  stops and she can try again.  Can she escape?  How?

 <li id="parabola">
  A parabola <code>y=x<sup>2</sup></code> was drawn, then the
  coordinate axes were erased.  Restore the axes with a compass and a
  ruler.

  <p>This problem was given during the Moscow State University Faculty
  of Mechanics and Mathematics entrance oral mathematics examination to
  a Jew, a graduate of <a href="http://www.sch57.msk.ru/">my high
  school</a>, in the Summer 1988 (3 years into "perestrojka").
  The guy could not do the problem in the 15-20 minutes allowed, so his
  two examiners failed him.  He went home and consulted a friend of his
  (a specialist on the matters related to the admission process), and
  was advised that the problem is unsolvable.  So the poor chap went
  back to appeal his failing grade (one could appeal on the day of the
  exam only).
  He found his two tormenters and told them that the problem had no
  solution.  They said it did.  He asked them to provide it.
  They said "this is an appeal hearing, not a consultation"
   (the usual answer to such a question).
  He said: "do you know the solution?"
  They said: "yes, of course."
  He said: "which one of you does?"
  They looked at each other and changed his grade from failing to
  passing, so he was admitted to the University.</p>

 <li id="computers">
  You are at a computer store which sells 3 computers: the Japanese one,
  which always answers any Yes-or-No question correctly, the Chinese
  one, which always answers any Yes-or-No question IN-correctly, and a
  Russian one, which sometimes tells the truth and sometimes lies - you
  never know.  You can ask one Yes-or-No question to any one of the
  three computers, after which you must buy any one of the three.  You
  don't want the Russian computer, but each of the other two is okay.
  What can you do?

 <li id="coins">
  You have 12 coins, one of which is counterfeit (lighter or heavier
  than the others - you do not know that), and a scales which lets you
  compare the weights of any two sets of coins.  You may use the scales
  3 times.  Determine which coin is counterfeit and whether it is
  heavier or lighter than the true ones.

  the plane, find the spere passing through the two points which
  minimizes the area of its intersection with the plane.

 <li id="bridge">
  A family of 4 is trying to cross a bridge at night.  One needs a
  flashlight to cross the bridge, and only two persons can cross the
  bridge at the same time, moving at the speed of the slower of the
  two.  Father crosses the bridge in 1 minute, Mother in 2 minutes,
  Child in 5 minutes and Granny in 10.  What is the fastest way for them
  to cross the bridge?

  <p>The obvious solution is for <code>F</code> to always carry the
  flashlight back, i.e., <code>FM+F+FC+F+FG</code> which means 19
  minutes (the notation means: first, <code>F</code> and <code>M</code>
  cross, then <code>F</code> carries the flashlight back, third,
  <code>F</code> and <code>C</code> cross together, fourth,
  <code>F</code> carries the flashlight back again, finally,
  <code>F</code> and <code>G</code> cross).  Can you do faster?</p>

  <p>It is alleged that this is the standard problem given at an
  interview at <a href="http://www.podval.org/~sds/lose.html">Microsoft</a>.</p>

 <li id="rope">
  You are on top of a 40 meter high building, you have a 30 meter long
  rope, and you may not jump or fall. There are no windows or doors, the
  only way down is along the flat wall with a single solid ring at
  midpoint (20 meters from both roof and ground), to which you can
  attach your rope.  You can cut and tie the rope as much as you like,
  disregard the length of the rope you spend on knots.

 <li id="mail">
  You have to send a diamond over the mail.  The post office sells boxes
  of all sizes equipped with multiple latches, as well as locks and keys
  (you can duplicate keys, and you can put more then one lock on the same
  box).  The boxes cannot be broken, so the recepient must have a key to
  open the box.  A key cannot be sent outside of a box, and an unlocked
  box cannot be mailed.  How can you send the valuable diamond?

  <p>There are two mathematicians in a room.  The product of two
  integers <code>&gt;=2</code> is given to the first mathematician, and
  the sum of the same two integers is given to the second one.  Hence,

  (from <a href="mailto:mkhmelnitskiy@yahoo.com">Mikhail Khmelnitskiy</a>)
  <p>A stupid king decided to eliminate his Academy of Sciences (as a
  cost-saving measure, after he slashed taxes), and decided to do it as
  follows: all the scholars are put in one line, one after another, so
  that the first one sees everyone ahead of him (second through last),
  while the second sees the third scholar through the last one, and the
  last one does not see anyone.  Then he puts a dunce cap, either red or
  blue, on each scholar's head, so that the first one knows the cap
  colors of rest of them, but not his own, the second knows the cap
  colors of the third through the last one etc.  Finally, each scholar,
  starting with the first one, is asked what color his cap is, and if
  his guess (which all the other scholars hear) is wrong, he is
  executed.  The scholars may agree in advance on what to do.</p>
  <p>What should the scholars do to minimize the casualties?</p>
  <p>E.g., they can agree that each odd-numbered scholar will say the
  cap color of the next one, so that the even-numbered scholars will
  survive.   Can they do better than that?</p>
