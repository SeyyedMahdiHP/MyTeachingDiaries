Indeed there are a lot of great alternatives to JavaScript (Elm and ClojureScript especially getting attention), though in terms of learning resources for beginners, JavaScript probably still has more support, especially for front-end development in terms of the community/ecosystem.\u003c/p>","isSpam":false,"isHighlighted":false,"points":2},{"forum":"codementorio","parent":2692440963,"isApproved":true,"author":{"username":"annliu1952","about":"","name":"Richard Eng","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"isAnonymous":false,"rep":1.2840529999999999,"profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/annliu1952/","url":"","reputation":1.2840529999999999,"location":"","isPrivate":false,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"joinedAt":"2013-06-28T10:34:17","id":"59534669","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/annliu1952.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/5953/4669/avatar32.jpg?1372415659"},"isCustom":true,"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/annliu1952.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/5953/4669/avatar92.jpg?1372415659","large":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/annliu1952.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/5953/4669/avatar92.jpg?1372415659"}}},"media":[],"isDeleted":false,"isFlagged":false,"dislikes":0,"raw_message":"TypeScript is not \"sort of\" JavaScript: it's a strict superset of JavaScript, which means it inherits all of JavaScript's problems.\n\nYou are insightful to recognize that weak typing and silent failure are two of the biggest problems with JavaScript.","createdAt":"2016-06-30T00:20:30","id":"2757687071","thread":"3705291959","depth":2,"numReports":0,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"likes":0,"isEdited":false,"message":"\u003cp>TypeScript is not \"sort of\" JavaScript: it's a strict superset of JavaScript, which means it inherits all of JavaScript's problems.\u003c/p>\u003cp>You are insightful to recognize that weak typing and silent failure are two of the biggest problems with JavaScript.\u003c/p>","isSpam":false,"isHighlighted":false,"points":0},{"forum":"codementorio","parent":2692255670,"isApproved":true,"author":{"username":"tomasdev","about":"","name":"tomasdev","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"isAnonymous":false,"rep":1.198335,"profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/tomasdev/","url":"","reputation":1.198335,"location":"","isPrivate":false,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"joinedAt":"2009-11-21T18:30:41","id":"1234035","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/tomasdev.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/123/4035/avatar32.jpg?1469741455"},"isCustom":true,"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/tomasdev.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/123/4035/avatar92.jpg?1469741455","large":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/tomasdev.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/123/4035/avatar92.jpg?1469741455"}}},"media":[],"isDeleted":false,"isFlagged":false,"dislikes":0,"raw_message":"Completely wrong buddy, completely wrong. jQuery is bs created for the UI and lazy programmers.

<p>"However, JavaScript is also known to be a difficult language as it is untyped and thus is difficult to debug."</p><p>"What language should a coding beginner learn? Clearly, if you wish to get into web development, you’d inevitably have to learn JavaScript, whether you like it or not."</p><p>Sorry, Ms. Chen, that isn't right. JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language like Python, Ruby, Smalltalk and others. It is not "untyped." Python, Ruby and Smalltalk are not difficult languages at all. They've been used very successfully to write large, complex applications. Some Python applications are over a quarter of a million lines long. Smalltalk has been used to write a <em>million-line</em> battle simulation program for the U.S. joint military called JWARS.</p><p>The reason why JavaScript is "difficult" and "difficult to debug" is because <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-non-grata/the-three-big-lies-about-javascript-e227cabe3beb" rel="nofollow">it is intrinsically a deeply-flawed programming language</a>. And the reason it is apparently so popular is because <strong>much of the IT community has bought into its insane hype</strong>.</p><p>If you're really interested in web development, <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-non-grata/the-super-surrogates-of-javascript-862460199915" rel="nofollow">I strongly recommend using a transpiled language</a> and learning just enough JavaScript to interface with jQuery. <a href="https://medium.com/smalltalk-talk/a-gentle-introduction-to-amber-8c532631e9ab" rel="nofollow">I use Amber Smalltalk</a> myself, but you can choose Python, Dart, Clojure, Scala, whatever. Use anything but JavaScript!</p><p>Otherwise, this is a very excellent article. Congratulations.</p>

<p>Hi Richard,</p><p>Thanks for the feedback and for sharing your thoughts! Indeed JavaScript is also referred to as dynamically typed - I took the definition "untyped" from the Wikipedia page :)</p><p>I suppose whoever edited that term in wanted to make a point that JavaScript has a weak type system compared to other dynamically-typed languages such as Smalltalk, Python, Ruby, etc, which makes it even more difficult to debug since things "fail silently". I see the weak type system was also a major issue you have with JavaScript too.</p><p>That said, TypeScript seems to be gaining a lot of attention as it seems to fix a lot of JavaScript's type-checking problems while still being JavaScript (sort of?). Indeed there are a lot of great alternatives to JavaScript (Elm and ClojureScript especially getting attention), though in terms of learning resources for beginners, JavaScript probably still has more support, especially for front-end development in terms of the community/ecosystem.</p>

<p>Completely wrong buddy, completely wrong. jQuery is bs created for the UI and lazy programmers. It had a great API that allowed new standards on browsers to be developed. I recommend you to read <a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/houdini/" rel="nofollow">https://dev.opera.com/articles...</a> and also stop commenting on languages you're not proficient at. It is sad to interview candidates with "8 years of javascript experience" that only know how to do a POST request in jQuery.</p>

<p>Hi! Such a great article, thanks for the info. I want to start coding but I'm an absolute beginner, hace no experience at all with any language. My goal at first stage is to be able to program websites for some startup projects I would like to launch. I understood the best for that would be learning HTML and CSS and maybe some PHP, but I'm really interested in knowing your thoughts about it. From the article I see maybe Javascript would work too? Thanks!!</p>

<p>Hello! This article is probably the best I've seen on this topic. It gives me a lot more information to add to my decision making process.</p><p>Maybe you guys can give me some advice. I'm at a coding school right now and I'm trying to decide what track to take. I will definitely be taking Javascript, but I'm trying to decide between the Ruby/Rails track and the C#/.Net track.</p><p>Those are the only two options they are offering at the time I'm taking the classes. I would like to enjoy the languages I choose of course, but I also want to be able to get a job.  What do you guys think? I'm currently in Portland, Or and would most likely like to stay here, but I'm also open to move to a different city.</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the kind words! It depends on what type of job you'd like. Ruby/Rails is more suitable for startup jobs, while C#/.Net is more suitable for corporate jobs (maybe non-tech companies other than gaming companies).</p><p>I'd suggest checking out the startup scene at Portland, checking job postings (which one is more popular), and also checking the meetup size for C# and Ruby. The local scene is important because not only will you get better support, companies also tend to hire the skill that has better supply to make up developer teams.</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>a CRM System usually requires good performance so some statically typed language like Java or C# would be better suited for such things. However if you mean you want to build custom and relatively simple CRMs, some dynamic language like Python would do since you'd get some prototype out quicker. Overall just pick a language you feel the most comfortable with since you'll learn faster that way. Once you know how to use one language and have built apps with it, it'll usually be easier to learn another.</p><p>Again, web development needs JavaScript, which is easy to get started with but difficult to get right. For JavaScript we generally recommend getting a mentor to guide you once you're at intermediate level :)</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>hello,</p><p>I want to learn, eventually, every other language. I've already started learning c++ on my own, but it's rather hard. I dont know why, but I cant get the logic right for the questions asked in the book from which im studying. My question is this- From which language should I start now ? After reading this very good, informative article, I think python or Javascript will be good. what are your thoughts ?</p>

<p>Hi, glad you found the article useful.</p><p>I'd suggest Python first to get a better understanding of how to program, and there are a lot of resources for beginners at <a href="https://www.codementor.io/learn-python-online" rel="nofollow">https://www.codementor.io/lear...</a></p><p>Not sure what you want to do, but if you want to be a web developer then you should learn JavaScript. If not, feel free to take the quiz <a href="http://bestprogramminglanguagefor.me/" rel="nofollow">http://bestprogramminglanguage...</a> to find where your true passion lies.</p><p>P.S. I'd strongly suggest against making "learn every other language" a goal--as a beginner, your goal should be to get comfortable with using one language to build things :)</p>

<p>Hi guys, I have a question. Let's say I already have a site that is built with cake php (built by a developer that left, there will be a new developer but I would like to learn it and not depending on them too much). Should I learn PHP first since this is my startup? Or should I just ignore it and get into Javascript? Is it worth my time to get into PHP now?</p>

<p>Whether it's worth the time to get into PHP is kind of relative to what people think, but unless you want to migrate the entire site's backend to Node.js with the help of an experienced developer (maybe you can hire a Codementor to help you), you might want to learn PHP first (it's easier to get into for non-developers).</p><p>This is so you'd know how to maintain your site's backend logic. A lot of front-end code is just for decoration if there's no communication between the browser and the server and no backend/server-side logic. After learning some PHP you can get into JavaScript for front-end things. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the great overview. I'm an "old" guy who wants to become a programmer. Is it realistic to get a developer / bioinformatics job with some certificates or do i need a bachelor/master to get a decent job? I only completed the first year of my study psychology at the university.</p><p>So after reading this i think it's best for me to start with Python. Do you know if there are leading certificates for Python programming?</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p><p>Thanks! Glad you found the article helpful.</p><p>Re: your question, I think O'Reilly (<a href="http://www.oreillyschool.com/certificate-programs/python-programming/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oreillyschool.com/c...</a> ) has a pretty good reputation. However, in terms of Python I'm not sure how necessary it is to get a certification, since some companies don't think certification reflects a programmer's abilities (for a better overview feel free to check out other people's answers on Quora about Python certifications <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-certification-exam-available-for-Python-and-Django)" rel="nofollow">https://www.quora.com/Is-there...</a>.</p><p>I'm not really an expert as every country's hiring culture may be different, so you'd have to take my words with a grain of salt, but several tech companies (esp. startups) don't care as much for college degrees/certificates for web developer hires (not sure about bioinformatics however). At least at Codementor, we've hired self-taught developers who majored in business (granted, they were either still in undegrad or fresh out of college). My general advice is to just build your portfolio and prove you can build things through projects you've worked on.</p><p>One is never too "old" to learn to program, but I'm not sure how you would define "old", since typical job market age discrimination may apply if you're over 30 or over 40 and applying for entry level positions. However, if you have existing experience in whatever field you want to work in, it may be possible to slowly make some transition bit by bit to be more development/coding oriented.</p>

<p>Thank You for that wonderful article. I am a newbie programmer that is trying to start with a language to get a job and then use that money to not only live but get a better laptop to finally learn Java for android applications. I am currently striving to learn fullstack Javascript and to be honest I was debating whether this would be a good start but since I had read your article I think I had made a right choice. Is their a language that is easy to learn and possbily make fast money?</p>

<p>Hi there, glad you liked this article! Re: your question, generally there's a big demand for web developers on freelance sites which may get you some pocket money, though the (price) competition should be pretty high as well.</p><p>Ultimately I think you'd be happier working on projects/areas you are passionate about, as it may take quite a lot of time investment to get the ball rolling and you'd be more motivated to learn more about how the language works, best practices, etc. JavaScript gets harder as you get into frameworks and building more complex things, but if your true interest is in Android development for some reason your laptop is not capable of running Eclipse/Android Studio/your IDE of choice, I think you might be interested in taking a look at React Native for Android if your laptop can handle it.</p>

<p>Very comprehensive and informative, but it misses one crucial point (that perhaps omar was thinking about too?). It takes years before you can make decent money out of programming skills - don't take my word for it, go to <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html" rel="nofollow">http://norvig.com/21-days.html</a>. Does anyone know what will be the most popular language by then? It really doesn't matter what language you pick to start learning; any good programmer is familiar with several. Just try a few then pick one you are comfortable with and that works for you. To be a successful programmer you need to learn to think logically, be able to visualise a complex structure and have fun doing it. Even Dartmouth Basic will get you those skills. Only once you have them do you need to worry about fashions in programming languages.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the comment :) I could be wrong, but my assumption is that people who look for freelancers at upwork are usually looking for the cheapest solution/going to pay less. As you've already seen, based on the graph above PHP devs earn the least, so they have the lowest rate (which means more job requests for them.)</p><p>JavaScript is hard (especially as complexity increases with AngularJS &amp; Node.js), hence AngularJS/Node.js devs can (and usually will) ask for a higher pay. I'm not sure how well Fullstack JavaScript devs do as freelancers on their own, but <a href="http://www.toptal.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.toptal.com</a> is another place to look at for AngularJS freelancing jobs with (I'm assuming) better pay than that of upwork. They do screen devs I think so you're probably better off starting at upwork and slowly build up your experience before you try other options.</p>

<p>Hi, thank you for advice.. I know that you have given wide information about each programming<br> language but still I am confused about which language is more suitable for full time freelancing as all information above is related to jobs in organisation.<br>My conditions are:<br>1) I want to become freelancer<br>2) I am not much experienced in any particular language<br>So based on my conditions please suggest me that in your opinion which language should I pick up  to start learn...I am thinking about javascript as I mentioned in my first comment but still your experience will help me to find best suitable language...</p>

<p>Hi Hardik, thanks for the response. Unfortunately I am not very knowledgeable about freelance job conditions/demands, so I can't really provide much of an opinion in that aspect.</p><p>As you grow as a developer you will eventually learn more languages anyway, so don't get stuck on what language to learn or you'll never get started.</p><p>That said, if you're trying to decide between PHP and JavaScript, stick with the language you feel more comfortable with just to understand programming concepts more. You'll eventually need to learn JavaScript anyway if you're aiming to become a full-stack dev, so it doesn't have to be your first language.</p>
